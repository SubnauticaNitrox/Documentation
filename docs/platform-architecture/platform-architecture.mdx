## Application projects

### @projects.subnautica_server.name@

Server application that is started by the @projects.launcher.name@ project. It has serialization logic for Subnautica game entities which makes it easier to communicate with Nitrox clients. A future plan is to abstract away serialization to custom Nitrox objects instead of Subnautica game objects.

### @projects.launcher.name@

[Avalonia](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/welcome) application for starting the server and/or Subnautica. The launcher will inject the Nitrox client code by patching the Assembly-CSharp.dll of Subnautica, just before starting Subnautica.

## Nitrox library projects

### NitroxModel

Contains code common to the client and server without referencing Subnautica code directly. For example: Packet classes that are serialized between client and server.

### NitroxModel-Subnautica

Contains code common to the client and server (like NitroxModel) with serialization logic for Subnautica game entities which makes it easier to communicate with Nitrox clients. A future plan is to abstract away serialization to custom Nitrox objects instead of Subnautica game objects.

### NitroxPatcher

Library that [is injected](https://github.com/SubnauticaNitrox/Nitrox/blob/master/Nitrox.Launcher/Models/Utils/NitroxEntryPatch.cs#L87-L111) into Subnautica. Handles modifying internal data structures and bootstrapping the client. It depends on the [HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX/wiki/Difference-between-Harmony-and-HarmonyX) library.

### NitroxServer

Server code library that knows about the packets sent between client and server. It should not reference any code of Subnautica directly.

### @projects.client.name@

Injected as a reference to Subnautica via the NitroxPatcher project. Contains monobehaviours, UDP client, and packet handlers.

### NitroxUnity

Asset library for UI/Game components introduced by Nitrox.

### Nitrox.Test

Core unit testing project for all the other projects.
