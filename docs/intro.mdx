# Subnautica Nitrox

This is the documentation for an open-source, multiplayer modification for the game [Subnautica](https://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/). [Early teaser video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw1lzj5l2zk)
Open source is at the core of Nitrox. The mod is in the very early stages of development; however, a solid foundation has been laid for the community to iterate on.

# Joining the dev team

The mod is open source and anyone can apply to contribute in its development. Are you experienced with C# and know about OOP? Experienced with the basics of Unity Engine and its component system? Are you also perhaps experienced with git version control? Then you got what it takes . All you gotta do, if you want to be part of the dev team, is ask in one of the public channels on our Discord and someone will get you sorted right away!
